# Design-Patterns

My studies on Software Design Patterns.

A design pattern is a good practice for solving a particular problem or even a class of problems when designing software. A design pattern is a general and reusable language-agnostic solution that helps the software designer avoid such solutions that work in the short term but will be a problem to maintain in the long term. So, good practices are merged into a design pattern that serves as a guideline to (maybe) follow: it is not a formula, but a recipe.

## Design Patterns Categories

Design patterns can be grouped into three (3) categories:

* [Creational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern) - how to create/instantiate objects.

* [Structural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_pattern) - how to structure relationships among objects.

* [Behavioural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_pattern) - how objects behave meaning communications among them.
